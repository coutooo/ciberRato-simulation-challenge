### Information

  This package contains a Java Interface to the CiberRato Robot Simulation
  Environment. The CiberRato 2008 tools (simulator and viewer) should be 
  installed in order to use this interface
  CiberRato Robot Simulation Environment simulates the movement
  of robots inside a labirinth.  Robots objective is to go from their
  starting position to beacon area and then return to their start position.
  This environment is used in
  Concurso Micro-Rato 2006 - Modalidade Ciber-Rato - University of Aveiro
